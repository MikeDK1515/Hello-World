#Description of what the program does
#A program that uses a for loop to print random integers between 25 and 35.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.

#1. Random Looping

import random

import math

print("The 10 random numbers between 25 and 35 is")
input()
for i in range(10):
    print(random.randint(25,35))
input()


#2. Random Parameter

#Description of what the program does
#A program that takes a list as a parameter and returns a random element from that list.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.
print("The president would randomly selected?")
input()
president = ["Trump","Biden"]
print(random.choice(president))
input()

#3. Random odd 

#Description of what the program does
#A program that returns a random odd integer between 0 and 100.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.

print("The random odd number would it be?")
input()
def odd():

    for n in range(100):
        number = random.randint(0,100)
        if number % 2 == 1:
            print(number)
            break

odd()
input()

#4. Pythagorean Theorem

#Description of what the program does
#A program that calculates the Pythagorean theorem using functions found in the math module.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.

print("The pythagorean theorem for 12 and 5 is...")
def c_squared(a,b):
   

    c = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

    return c


print(c_squared(a = 12, b = 5))
