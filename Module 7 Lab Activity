Problem 1 - Infinite
#Description of what the program does
#A program that writes an infinite while loop that prints “Infinite” an infinite number of times.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.

#Note to self:
#While loop = Infinite
#For loop = Certain amount of time

while True:
    print("Infinite")
    
    

Problem 2 - Random Integers in while

#Description of what the program does
#A program that uses while loop to print random integers between 25 and 35.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.

import random

count = 1
while count <= 10:
    print(random.randint(25,35))
    count += 1


Problem 3 - Check Inputs

#Description of what the program does
#A program that takes a user input, then uses a while loop to check if that input is the letter A, B, or C.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.


user_input = input("Type either A,B,or C").upper()
while user_input not in ["A","a","B","b","C","c"]:
    user_input = input("Type either A,B,or C")


Problem 4- Archery

#Description of what the program does
#A program that keeps track of the score in archery.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.
import random
scoretracker = 0
Card = []
arrows = 10

while arrows > 0:
    scoreboard = random.randint(0,10)
    Card.append(scoreboard)

    if scoreboard == 0:
        scoretracker -= 0
        arrows -= 0
    elif scoreboard == 10:
        scoretracker += 20
        arrows -= 1
    else:
        scoretracker += scoreboard
        arrows -= 1

print(scoretracker,Card)
