#Description of what the program does
#This program allows you to repear "Hello World" 100 times.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.


for x in range(100):
    print("Hello World")



#Description of what the program does
#This program takes a list as a parameter and prints each of the numbers on separate lines.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.


#Problem 2
#Description of what the program does
#This program takes a list as a parameter and prints each of the numbers on separate lines.
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.


#Problem 2a:

def number (x):
    for x in (12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20):
        print(x)


number_list = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
number(number_list)

#Problem 2b:

def number (x):
    for x in (12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20):
        print(x*x)


number_list = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
number(number_list)


#Problem 3

#Description of what the program does
#It asks the user for the number of sides, the length of the side, the color of the line, and the fill color of a regular polygon. 
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.

import turtle


def polygon(side,length,color):
    t.fillcolor(color)
    t.begin_fill()
    for num in range(side):
        t.left(360/side)
        t.forward(length)
    t.end_fill()


shape_one = int(input("How many sides?"))
print("")

shape_two = int(input("What is the length?"))
print("")

shape_three = input("What is the color?")
print("")

t= turtle.Turtle()

polygon(shape_one,shape_two,shape_three)

#Problem 4

#Description of what the program does
#A program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. 
#Description of known issues
#Before, there's no functions in the program.


for integers in range(51):
    if integers % 3 == 0 and integers % 5 == 0:
        print("Divisible by both")
        continue
    elif integers % 3 == 0:
        print("Divisible by three")
        continue
    elif integers % 5 == 0:
        print("Divisible by five")
        continue
    print(integers)
